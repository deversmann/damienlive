*I was interviewed for an article on Federal News Network.  The original can be found here: [How automation can fill in holes on disaster planning](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/open-first/2020/11/how-automation-can-fill-in-holes-on-disaster-planning/).  A few quotes follow, check out the link for the entire article:*


> [T]hat presents these organizations with an opportunity: Now is the perfect time for self-evaluation, to determine what did and didn't work, and reconsider the way organizations prepare for disasters and disruptions.


> [D]owntime between processes has become a problem during the pandemic. With everyone working remotely, it takes longer to hand off jobs between employees.


> "The better approach is not to have a plan for everything, but to develop more flexibility, implement tools and processes to be more flexible," Eversmann said. "Break down monolithic processes into smaller pieces that can be moved around."


> "Sometimes it's culture, sometimes it's people or processes," Eversmann said. "That's the DevOps trio: people, processes, tech. People are realizing that not everything is a tech problem. Instead, we can work on all three together."
