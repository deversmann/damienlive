*I wrote an article for EDUCAUSE.  The original can be found here: [Top Ways Educational Institutions Dealt with 2020](https://er.educause.edu/blogs/sponsored/2021/1/top-ways-educational-institutions-dealt-with-2020).  A few quotes follow, check out the link for the entire article:*


> Here are some of the other top efforts that we have heard about from our customers regarding how they have dealt with the challenges resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Some of these activities are creative, and some are overdue, but they are all amazing ways to help instruction and learning flourish in these new and uncertain times.

> ... The systems supporting these processes, many of which were due for modernization, are now in a dire state. And institutions are starting to update to modern architectures like microservices and containerize these workloads.

> One thing is clear: Through all of this upheaval, the day-to-day work continues. Now, however, that work is done remotely. Tasks are being done more frequently and more often by less experienced employees.

> These are trying times, but students, teachers, and health care practitioners are finding new and innovative ways to protect their data, enable those who support them, and advance their researchâ€”all of which will help us get through this era and beyond.
