*I was interviewed for an piece by GovLoop.  The original can be found here: [Reinventing Government: 20 Innovations for 2020](https://go.govloop.com/2020-gov-innovations.html) on page 23.  The piece was titled, "Three Ways to Prepare Yourself for the Unexpected." A few quotes follow, check out the link for the entire article:*


> “Disaster planning is perpetually chasing our tail trying to figure out what the unknowns are,” Eversmann said. “We’re not going to figure out all the unknowns.”


> As agencies become more agile, their workers can react to hurdles such as COVID-19 with fewer disruptions to the products and services they deliver. Agencies can grow more agile by analyzing and making decisions about their data quicker and more efficiently.

> “Enterprise automation looks at everything from a higher level and asks, ‘How can we connect these together?’” Eversmann said.


> “If we’re going to put a positive spin on 2020, there are a lot of people with more of an open mind for change,” Eversmann said.
