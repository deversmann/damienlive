*I wrote an article on State Tech Magazine.  The original can be found here: [How App Developers Can Meet Customer Demand During a Crisis](https://statetechmagazine.com/article/2020/08/how-app-developers-can-meet-customer-demand-during-crisis).  A few quotes follow, check out the link for the entire article:*


> Applications that were never expected to support more than a meager amount of traffic are now seeing 10, 20 or 50 times what they were originally designed to handle. New features and apps are needed now that we never dreamed would exist. What’s a development organization to do?


> You’ve heard it all before: Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, Networking as a Service, Storage as a Service — the list goes on and on. But what do these things really mean? At their core, they mean "on-demand." Your infrastructure can’t support something, but someone else’s can.


> Modern architectures do not need to be released with a big bang. On the contrary, they are practically designed to be implemented piecemeal or as time and resources allow. API managers exist to help you maintain your growing catalog of APIs as you migrate to microservices.


> It might be easy to push security to the side when wrapped up in urgent activities, but that must be avoided at all costs. Doing so can lead to mistakes and vulnerabilities that can end up crippling an organization.


> Use this time to your benefit and start on the path to becoming a modern application development shop using cutting-edge technologies.
