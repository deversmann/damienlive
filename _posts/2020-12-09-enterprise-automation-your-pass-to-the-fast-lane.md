This is a presentation I gave at the [39th Government IT Symposium](https://mngts.org/itsym/) in Minnesota recently entitled "Enterprise Automation: Your Pass to the Fast Lane".  Learn what Enterprise Automation is and how to get there... and how it all relates to cars?  It's a repeat conversation that I've given before, but it's just as good!
