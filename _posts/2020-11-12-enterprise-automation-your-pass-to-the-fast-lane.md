This is a presentation I gave at the [Merit Member Conference 2020](https://www.merit.edu/community/events/mmc-2020/) in Michigan recently entitled "Enterprise Automation: Your Pass to the Fast Lane".  Learn what Enterprise Automation is and how to get there... and how it all relates to cars?  This is the second iteration of this talk with a few improvements!
