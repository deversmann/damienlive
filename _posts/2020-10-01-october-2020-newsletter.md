Here's an incomplete list of events on the Red Hat calendar.  Follow the links for more info.  Note that all events are virtual till further notice. 

Also, don't forget: the first 3 Wednesdays of every month at Noon CT, I host the [MOSH>pit](https://www.damien.live/moshpit), a virtual gathering of geeks and geek wannabees who get together to discuss the topics of the day.  These topics include, but are not limited to, Quarantine Snacks, Social Justice in IT, OpenSource Practice, Perpetual 3-day Weekends and more!  It's a loosely led virtual group discussion about stuff and things.  Hope to see you there!
