This is a presentation I gave at the [39th Government IT Symposium](https://mngts.org/itsym/) in Minnesota recently entitled "The Future Isn't Backwards Compatible".  Learn what the how's and why's of Digital Transformation from a Red Hat perspective.  Even see me deal with a little technical snafu!
