*I was interviewed for an article on Federal News Network.  The original can be found here: [How State, Local Govts and Higher Ed Face Similar IT Challenges to Federal, but with Fewer Resources](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/open-first/2019/12/how-state-local-govts-and-higher-ed-face-similar-it-challenges-to-federal-but-with-fewer-resources/).  A few quotes follow, check out the link for the entire article:*


> "The hardest part of modernizing your IT infrastructure isn't really tied up in the software or technology," Damien Eversmann, Red Hat senior solutions architect, said. "The technology is there. In most cases it's robust, with a lot of features, functionality, and benefits. The place where most people get tied up is the culture of their organization."


> "For geeks, fun and interesting means cutting edge and modern," Eversmann said. "And the nice thing is that we're at a point where some of the hottest solutions, some of the most modern technologies are actually targeted at saving money."


> And never mind that common refrain about automation taking jobs away.
"In IT, we already have people whose workloads are 150%-200% of what a normal workload should be," Eversmann said. "So automation isn't about laying people off and saving money that way. It's about enabling the workforce."
